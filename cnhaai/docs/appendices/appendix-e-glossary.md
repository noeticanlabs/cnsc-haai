# Appendix E: Glossary

**Alphabetical Reference for All CNHAAI Terms**

## A

**Abstraction**: A lossy compression of detail that preserves task-relevant structure.

**Abstraction Contract**: A formal specification defining the requirements, constraints, and guarantees for an abstraction.

**Abstraction Layer**: A level of abstraction with specific characteristics (grain size, scope, stability).

**Abstraction Ladder**: A curated sequence of layers with explicit ascent/descent rules for vertical reasoning.

**Abstraction Type**: Classification of abstractions (descriptive, mechanistic, normative, comparative).

**Ascent**: The act of moving from lower to higher abstraction levels (generalization).

## C

**Chain Receipt**: A receipt that references its parent receipts, forming a chain.

**Coherence**: The property of maintaining consistency and integrity across abstractions.

**Coherence Budget**: A limit on the total degradation allowed in a system.

**Commit Frontier**: The boundary between soft (temporary) and hard (persistent) memory.

**Cross-Layer Alignment**: The property that abstractions at different layers are consistent with each other.

## D

**Debt**: The accumulated cost of unrepaired abstraction degradation.

**Descent**: The act of returning to lower abstraction levels for recovery or detail retrieval.

## E

**Episode**: A complete reasoning session in CNHAAI.

**Evidence**: Information supporting an abstraction.

## G

**Gate**: A runtime constraint that validates transitions between states.

**GHLL**: Glyphic High-Level Language - the human-readable rewrite language layer.

**GLLL**: Glyphic Low-Level Language - the binary encoding layer.

**Governance**: The system by which abstractions are created, validated, used, and repaired.

## H

**Hierarchy**: An organization of abstractions into levels.

**Hysteresis**: The property of gradual, not sudden, degradation.

## I

**Invariant**: A property that must always hold.

## L

**Layer**: See Abstraction Layer.

**Ladder**: See Abstraction Ladder.

## M

**Memory (Hard)**: Persistent, durable memory that survives system restarts.

**Memory (Soft)**: Temporary, volatile memory.

## N

**NSC**: Network Structured Code - the intermediate representation layer.

## P

**Phase**: A distinct stage in CNHAAI reasoning (acquisition, construction, reasoning, validation, recovery).

**PoC**: Principle of Coherence - the fundamental principle governing CNHAAI.

**Provenance**: The origin and history of information.

## R

**Rail**: A constraint on the evolution of a system over time.

**Receipt**: A cryptographic record of a reasoning step.

**Reconstruction Bound**: The limit of how well original detail can be recovered from an abstraction.

**Residual**: A measure of abstraction quality degradation.

## S

**Schema**: A formal specification for data structures.

**Seam**: A boundary between layers where transformations occur.

## T

**Termination**: The property of finite reasoning processes.

**Trace**: A complete record of phase transitions and reasoning steps.

## V

**Validity Horizon**: The time period during which an abstraction remains valid.
