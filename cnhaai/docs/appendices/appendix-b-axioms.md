# Appendix B: Design Axioms

**Foundational Axioms That Cannot Be Contradicted**

## Core Axioms

### Axiom 1: Abstractions are Tools, Not Truths

> Abstractions are simplifications of reality. They are useful tools for reasoning but should not be confused with truth itself.

**Implications:**
- All abstractions must be traceable to evidence
- Abstractions have limited validity scopes
- Abstractions must be revisable when evidence changes

### Axiom 2: Every Abstraction Must Pay Rent in Coherence

> Every abstraction consumes coherence budget. Abstractions that don't provide sufficient value should be eliminated.

**Implications:**
- Coherence is a finite resource
- Value must be measured against coherence cost
- Low-value abstractions should be pruned

### Axiom 3: Descent is Not Failure; Refusal to Descend Is

> Returning to lower abstraction levels to retrieve detail is correct behavior. Refusing to descend when coherence degrades is failure.

**Implications:**
- Descent should be encouraged, not stigmatized
- Systems must always support descent
- Refusal to descend indicates a problem

### Axiom 4: Receipts Precede Trust

> Trust must be earned through verifiable records. No trust without receipts.

**Implications:**
- Every significant action must be recorded
- Receipts must be cryptographically protected
- Verification must be independent

## Derived Axioms

### Derived Axiom 1: Transparency Over Secrecy

> System behavior must be visible and understandable. Secrecy undermines verification.

### Derived Axiom 2: Recovery Over Perfection

> Systems will fail. Recovery is more important than preventing all failures.

### Derived Axiom 3: Explicit Over Implicit

> System state and reasoning must be explicit. Implicit knowledge cannot be verified.

### Derived Axiom 4: Gradual Degradation Over Sudden Failure

> When systems must fail, they should fail gracefully, not catastrophically.
