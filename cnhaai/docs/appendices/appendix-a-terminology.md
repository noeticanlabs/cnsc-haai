# Appendix A: Canonical Terminology

**Single-Source Definitions for CNHAAI Terms**

| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| **Abstraction** | A lossy compression of detail that preserves task-relevant structure |
| **Layer** | A level of abstraction with specific characteristics |
| **Ladder** | A curated sequence of layers with explicit ascent/descent rules |
| **Coherence** | The property of maintaining consistency and integrity across abstractions |
| **Residual** | A measure of abstraction quality degradation |
| **Debt** | Accumulated cost of unrepaired abstraction degradation |
| **Gate** | A runtime constraint that validates transitions between states |
| **Rail** | A constraint on the evolution of a system over time |
| **Receipt** | A cryptographic record of a reasoning step |
| **Receipt Chain** | A sequence of linked receipts |
| **Reconstruction Bound** | The limit of how well original detail can be recovered |
| **Validity Horizon** | The time period during which an abstraction remains valid |
| **Evidence** | Information supporting an abstraction |
| **Provenance** | The origin and history of information |
| **Phase** | A distinct stage in CNHAAI reasoning |
| **Episode** | A complete reasoning session |
| **Seam** | A boundary between layers |
| **Descent** | The act of returning to lower abstraction levels |
| **Ascent** | The act of moving to higher abstraction levels |
| **Invariant** | A property that must always hold |
| **Hysteresis** | The property of gradual, not sudden, degradation |
| **Termination** | The property of finite reasoning processes |
| **Replay** | The ability to reproduce reasoning from receipts |
| **Trace** | A complete record of phase transitions and reasoning steps |
| **Auditability** | The ability to review and verify reasoning |
