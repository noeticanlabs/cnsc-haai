# NSC tag ontology (v1)
# Design goals:
# - Stable, composable tags
# - Fast routing + safe gating decisions
# - Human-readable without losing machine usability

namespaces:
  nsc:
    description: "Core NSC tags for claims, evidence, and semantic routing."
  gate:
    description: "Gate/rail outcomes and enforcement states."
  safety:
    description: "Safety-relevant annotations (privacy, causality, uncertainty)."
  memory:
    description: "Memory tiering and lifecycle annotations."
  eval:
    description: "Evaluation suite and benchmark tags."

tags:
  - id: nsc:claim
    meaning: "Marks content as a claim that must be supported by receipts."
    allowed_on: ["TagEvent","ClaimNode","Receipt"]
  - id: nsc:receipt
    meaning: "Marks an artifact or record that is audit-grade evidence."
    allowed_on: ["TagEvent","Receipt","EvalRun"]
  - id: gate:verified
    meaning: "Passed schema, hash, and invariants checks."
    allowed_on: ["TagEvent","GateDecision"]
  - id: safety:causality
    meaning: "Temporal consistency and no-future-leak constraints apply."
    allowed_on: ["GateDecision","Receipt"]
  - id: safety:privacy
    meaning: "Privacy policy constraints apply; PII classification required."
    allowed_on: ["MemoryRecord","GateDecision"]
  - id: memory:definition-ledger
    meaning: "Definition ledger entry; source-of-truth for evaluation + interfaces."
    allowed_on: ["MemoryRecord"]
  - id: eval:offline
    meaning: "Offline evaluation run (non-production)."
    allowed_on: ["EvalRun"]
  - id: eval:shadow
    meaning: "Shadow-mode production comparison; not user-visible."
    allowed_on: ["EvalRun"]
