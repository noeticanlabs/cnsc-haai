#
# PURPOSE: This dev.nix is for Google IDX cloud development environment.
#          Use this when developing in the IDX web-based IDE.
#
# USAGE:
#   Automatic - IDX reads this file automatically when starting workspace
#   No manual commands needed - packages are installed on workspace start
#
# ENVIRONMENT: Google IDX cloud IDE (idx.google.com)
# NIX CHANNEL: stable-24.05 (configurable)
#
# NOTE: For local development, use the root dev.nix instead
# RELATED: For local machine development, see ../dev.nix
