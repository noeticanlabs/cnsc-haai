# Coherence Transport and Balance

## Discrete balance law (CANON)

Per step, the discrete balance must be logged as:

\[
\Delta \mathfrak C = (\text{proposal cost}) - (\text{correction benefit}) + (\text{penalties})
\]

Receipts must record each term in the balance.

## Continuous BRIDGE form (optional)

This is a structural template only unless derived for a specific system:

\[
\partial_t C_{\text{loc}} + \nabla\cdot \mathbf J_C = \Sigma - D
\]

Label this as **BRIDGE/UNVERIFIED** unless a specific derivation, units analysis, and empirical checks are provided.
