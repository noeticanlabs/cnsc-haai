# Bridge Notes: Time, GR, PDE, AI (BRIDGE/UNVERIFIED)

This document contains **BRIDGE/UNVERIFIED** hypotheses only. Nothing here is required for compliance.

## Bridge hypotheses (explicitly labeled)

* **[UNVERIFIED] Time dilation as governance:** Step-size control and retry mechanics resemble time dilation in a governance sense.
* **[UNVERIFIED] Time dilation as physics:** Any physical claim requires derivation, units, and empirical checks.
* **[UNVERIFIED] GR/PDE analogies:** Conservation and transport analogies must be derived for each system.
* **[UNVERIFIED] AI reasoning analogies:** Tool use and evidence escalation can mirror constraint transport.

## Verification path for elevation

To elevate any bridge claim to CANON, provide:

1. **Derivation** with explicit assumptions.
2. **Units analysis** for all terms.
3. **Empirical checks** with measurable thresholds.
4. **Receipts** demonstrating replay under the proposed mapping.
