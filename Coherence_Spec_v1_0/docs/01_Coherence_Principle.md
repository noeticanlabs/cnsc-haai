# Principle of Coherence

## Canonical statement

**Principle of Coherence:** A system’s **predictive integrity** is governed by a measurable quantity (coherence) that can be **budgeted, transported, depleted, and stabilized** by bounded corrections whose costs are logged.

## Scope

This principle applies to:

* Physical systems (e.g., simulation of fields or particles).
* Symbolic systems (e.g., logical proofs, constraint programs).
* Solvers and controllers (e.g., PDE/ODE integrators, optimization loops).
* AI reasoning and planning systems (e.g., tool-augmented agents).

## Three laws (canonical)

1. **Budget / Balance:** Coherence is a measurable budget (debt) that must remain within declared bounds to accept evolution.
2. **Transport / Currents:** Coherence changes are attributed to proposals, corrections, and penalties, and are logged.
3. **Governance / Affordability:** Steps are affordable only when hard gates pass and soft policy is satisfied.

## Non-negotiable rule

Accepted evolution **must remain inside the declared safe region** (gates). Violations trigger bounded rails or abort.

## Operational claim

Coherence is **not “truth.”** It is the **affordability condition** for making claims or taking steps under declared constraints.
