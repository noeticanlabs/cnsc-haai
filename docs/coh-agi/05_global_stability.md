# Global Hybrid Stability

**Stability Analysis for Hybrid Systems**

## Lyapunov Stability

The budget B serves as a Lyapunov function:
```
dB/dt ≤ 0
```

This ensures the system never spontaneously degrades beyond recoverable limits.

## Hybrid Stability

Combining discrete slabs with continuous trajectories:
- Slabs provide discrete checkpoints
- Continuous flow provides smooth transitions
- Both maintain stability guarantees
