## 1. What is Coh-AGI?

Coh-AGI is a **coherence-native cognitive runtime** that treats coherence as the primary optimization objective rather than likelihood or reward signals.

> *Intelligence is not prediction. Intelligence is staying coherent while changing.*

## 2. Core Components

| Component | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **ATS** | Abstract Theory of Semantics - the consensus kernel |

| **Slabs** | Batches of micro receipts with Merkle roots |
| **Merkle Trees** | Cryptographic commitment to receipt integrity |
| **Chain Hash** | Universal chain hashing with JCS + domain separation |
| **Retention Policies** | Rules for when data can be deleted |
| **Fraud Proofs** | Disputes for invalid receipts |
| **Finalization** | Authorization for deletion after retention |
| **Topology Engine** | Atlas expansion/pruning with budget constraints |
| **Autonomic System** | μ modulation and fatigue tracking |

## 4. Key Principles

1. **Coherence as Invariant**: The system maintains coherence as a hard constraint
2. **Receipts Over Explanations**: Every decision produces immutable evidence
3. **Determinism by Default**: Same inputs → same outputs
4. **Certified Forgetting**: Data is deleted only after formal verification
5. **Hybrid Safety**: Topology changes only at slab boundaries
