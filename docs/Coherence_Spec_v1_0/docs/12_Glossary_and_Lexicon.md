# Glossary and Lexicon

## Canonical terms (CANON unless noted)

* **Coherence:** measurable governance budget (debt + residual vector) that determines affordability.
* **Residual:** measurable defect relative to constraints, normalized to budget boundary.
* **Debt (\(\mathfrak C\)):** scalar integrity budget derived from residuals and penalties.
* **Gates:** hard/soft acceptability checks that determine admissible evolution.
* **Rails:** bounded corrective actions invoked when gates fail.
* **Receipts:** structured logs for decisions, residuals, and actions.
* **Hysteresis:** separate enter/exit thresholds to prevent chatter.
* **Replay:** recomputation of decisions from receipts within tolerance.
* **Certificate:** run summary containing final hash and maxima.
* **Transport / current:** structured change or flow of coherence (CANON for discrete; BRIDGE for continuous).
* **Dissipation:** deliberate reduction of debt via bounded correction.
* **Reconstruction:** fidelity of state representation or model output.
* **Contradiction:** detectable inconsistency within symbolic claims or constraints.

## CANON vs BRIDGE tags

* **CANON:** required for compliance and auditable governance.
* **BRIDGE/UNVERIFIED:** optional hypotheses or cross-domain analogies.

## Naming rules for new terms

* Provide a **measurement**, **normalization**, and **policy impact** (gate/rail linkage).
* Label BRIDGE/UNVERIFIED terms explicitly.
