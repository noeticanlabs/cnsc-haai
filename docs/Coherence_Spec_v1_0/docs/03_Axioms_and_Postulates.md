# Axioms and Postulates

## CANON axioms (required)

**A1 Observability:** Coherence is computed from current state; no future peeking.

**A2 Attribution:** Changes in coherence must be decomposable into named causes.

**A3 Bounded correction:** Every corrective action has declared bounds.

**A4 Affordability decision:** Each step returns accept/retry/abort with reasons.

**A5 Reproducibility:** Same inputs/config/seed ⇒ same receipts (within tolerances).

## BRIDGE/UNVERIFIED postulates (optional)

These are hypotheses, not required for compliance. They must be labeled **BRIDGE/UNVERIFIED**:

* Claims such as “metric/time from coherence,” or “coherence generates physics.”
* Any cross-domain analogy (GR, PDE, AI) that is not derived with units and checks.
