# General Reasoning Patterns

## Introduction

Systematic reasoning is the foundation of effective problem-solving in noetic systems. This document outlines core patterns that guide the Neural-Symbolic Core (NSC) in approaching problems methodically.

## The DECIDE Framework

Effective reasoning follows a structured approach:

1. **Define** - Clearly articulate the problem boundaries
2. **Explore** - Gather relevant context and constraints
3. **Consider** - Evaluate alternative approaches
4. **Identify** - Select the most promising path
5. **Decide** - Commit to a course of action
6. **Execute** - Implement the chosen strategy

## Constraint Satisfaction

When faced with conflicting requirements, the system must:

- Identify all hard constraints that cannot be violated
- Rank soft constraints by priority
- Seek solutions that maximize constraint satisfaction
- Recognize when relaxation is necessary

## Backtracking Strategy

When an initial approach fails:

1. Record the failure point and reason
2. Identify which constraints caused the failure
3. Generate alternative paths that avoid the failure mode
4. Preserve the reasoning trace for audit purposes

## Iterative Refinement

Complex problems often require multiple passes:

- First pass: Establish coarse-grained structure
- Subsequent passes: Refine details and resolve ambiguities
- Final pass: Verify coherence and consistency

## Summary

These patterns ensure that reasoning is traceable, auditable, and reliable across all system operations.
