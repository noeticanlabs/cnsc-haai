# Coherence Principles

## Definition

Coherence is the property that ensures all parts of a noetic system work together harmoniously. It guarantees that outputs are consistent, complete, and internally aligned with system goals.

## Core Principles

### Principle 1: Internal Consistency

All outputs must be internally consistent:
- No contradictions within the same output
- All claims must align with established facts
- References must resolve correctly within context

### Principle 2: Goal Alignment

All operations must serve system goals:
- Every action should advance a defined objective
- Trade-offs must be explicitly reasoned
- Goal hierarchy must be respected

### Principle 3: Boundary Integrity

Operations must respect system boundaries:
- Cannot exceed allocated resource budgets
- Must honor security and privacy constraints
- Must maintain separation of concerns

### Principle 4: Traceability

All reasoning must be auditable:
- Every decision must have documented rationale
- Sources must be traceable and verifiable
- Alternative paths must be considered

## Coherence Functions

The system uses coherence functions to evaluate:

| Function | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| Consistency Check | Detect contradictions |
| Completeness Check | Ensure all required elements present |
| Alignment Score | Measure goal alignment |
| Boundary Compliance | Verify resource and security limits |

## Violation Handling

When coherence violations are detected:

1. **Classification** - Determine violation type and severity
2. **Containment** - Prevent spread of inconsistent state
3. **Resolution** - Apply correction or request repair
4. **Recovery** - Restore coherent state
5. **Documentation** - Record violation and resolution

## Balance Mechanism

Coherence must be balanced with:
- **Performance** - Excessive checking slows operation
- **Flexibility** - Rigid coherence blocks adaptation
- **Resource Usage** - Deep checking consumes resources

The system maintains optimal balance through adaptive thresholds and learned heuristics.
